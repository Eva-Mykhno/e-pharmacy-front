Hello, my name's Eva Mykhno. I'm a full stack developer, and I'm excited to introduce my project!

## Project layout

To create the E-Pharmacy project, I used [this layout](<https://www.figma.com/file/qrKzOBVqM6zOZNFkTOpEO0/E-PHARMACY-(clients)?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=O9kTuPJAS2bjEuwM-0>) from Figma.
